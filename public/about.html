<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My background is in Mechatronics R&D, where I honed my skills in designing complex systems,
   structural analysis, and leading projects from idea to reality. However, my exploration into
   software development, particularly through full-stack studies, unlocked a new level of passion
   and purpose.
  </p>

<p>I am now committed to transitioning into a developer career, where I believe my strong
  foundation in logical thinking, project lifecycle management, and systematic problem-solving
  will be a significant advantage. I am eager to find a role that offers not just a better
  environment and salary, but the chance to fully invest my talents in building the digital world.
